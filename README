Windows 10 Issues

As a user of both a Linux and Windows operating system, I find myself having
  to endure many of Windows' imperfections just to have a reasonably well
  working gaming system. I despise the act of dual booting and it's easier to
  set up a VM to program in than the alternative.

Because many of my friends ask "Why do you dislike Windows 10?", "What sort of
  problems are you experiencing with Windows 10?" and "Why don't you use Linux
  instead?", here you go - this repository is for you.

This repository is a collection of issues I've experienced while running
  Windows. You may not have encountered the same problems, that's great - but
  I have. Anyone is free to create an issue if they wish. Note that I do a lot
  of tinkering with my system, I like configuring it to what I like, and some
  people do not. I run into issues because I *have* configured my policy
  settings, privacy options, drives and default settings.

Potential solutions can be left on comments, although the chances are that
  they have already been tried. Workarounds are welcome as well.

This repository is by no means official, I just wanted a personal repository
  location where I can store my issues.

Without further ado, behold the problem that is my operating system.
