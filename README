Windows 10 Issues

As an user of both a Linux and Windows operating system, I find myself having
  to endure many of Windows' imperfections just to have a reasonably well
  working gaming system. I despite the act of dual booting and it's easier to
  set up a VM to program in than the alternative.

Because many of my friends ask "Why do you dislike Windows 10?", "What sort of
  problems are you experiencing with Windows 10?" and "Why don't you use linux
  instead?", here you go - this repository is for you.

This repository is a collection of issues I've experienced while running
  Windows. You may not have encountered the same problems, that's great - but
  I have. Anyone is free to create an issue if they wish.

Potential solutions can be left on comments, although the chances are that 
  they have already been tried. Workarounds are welcome as well.

This repository is by no means official, I just wanted a personal repository
  location where I can store my issues.

Without further ado, behold the problem that is my Operating System.
